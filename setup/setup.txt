If you are still willing to set up your environment for Go programming language,
you need the following two software available on your computer −
* A text editor
* Go compiler

Download and install GO here
https://golang.org/dl/

Test GO:
- on terminal `go run setup/hello.go`

Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program −

*   The first line of the program package main defines the package name in which this program should lie.
    It is a mandatory statement, as Go programs run in packages. The main package is the starting point
    to run the program. Each package has a path and name associated with it.

*   The next line import "fmt" is a preprocessor command which tells the Go compiler to include
    the files lying in the package fmt.

*   The next line func main() is the main function where the program execution begins.

*   The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is there to add comments in the program.
    Comments are also represented using // similar to Java or C++ comments.

*   The next line fmt.Println(...) is another function available in Go which causes the message
    "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen. Here fmt package has exported Println method
    which is used to display the message on the screen.

*   Notice the capital P of Println method. In Go language, a name is exported if it starts with capital letter.
    Exported means the function or variable/constant is accessible to the importer of the respective package.
