Type casting is a way to convert a variable from one data type to another data type.
For example, if you want to store a long value into a simple integer then you can type
cast long to int. You can convert values from one type to another using the cast operator.
Its syntax is as follows −

type_name(expression)


Example
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one
integer variable by another to be performed as a floating number operation.


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   var sum int = 17
   var count int = 5
   var mean float32
   
   mean = float32(sum)/float32(count)
   fmt.Printf("Value of mean : %f\n",mean)
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

Value of mean : 3.400000
